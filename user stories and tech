Fake Boggle

MVP:
- As a user (AAU), I want to be able to search for words, three letters or 
longer in length, in the adjacent tiles (across, down, forwards, backwards, 
and diagonally) of a 16x16 grid of random letters, A-Z.
- AAU, I want to be able to enter these words into a text box, and if they 
 exist in the dictionary, have the points corresponding to the length 
 of the word added to my score (3-4: 1pt., 5: 2pts., 6: 3pts., 7: 5pts., or
 8+: 5pts.), and have my total score and previously entered words displayed.

Stretch: 
- Tiered leader board (or non-tiered, if every game board is randomized )
- Multi-player (Socket.io)
- Multiple grid sizes 
- Option to display word definitions
- Some sort of a daily grid
- Mobile-friendly
- Time-elapsed
- Randomize letter directions
- Calculate total possible points

Tech: 
- Python (or JavaScript, depending on whether I could render the puzzle 
logic with Python), React, Express, and the WordsAPI. In addition, I would like 
to include Socket.io as a stretch goal.
